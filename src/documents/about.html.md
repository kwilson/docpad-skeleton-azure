The short version: I’m a .NET Developer, JavaScript enthusiast, Android user, sometime musician and sometime cook originally from Kilmarnock, Scotland, but now settled in Glasgow.

*The longer version:*

I’m currently working as a senior .NET developer with CFM and am enjoying the mix of building interesting things and pushing forward with new technology that comes as part of that.

As well as .NET, I’m very interested in JavaScript development, mobile-first design and agile methodologies.

When not stuck at a computer, I’ve also been known to sing at karaoke.
